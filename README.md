# My-Beta-Portfolio-Kayisha Ulysse

## Kayisha Ulysse Inspo Portfolio
This is a creative portfolio that intergrates my personal some of my design asethetics with the fundamentals of JavaScript/Jquery, CSS and HTML. This site is meant to serve as a representation of how I can creatively solve the task of achieving a web design that is well built, fully functional, engaging, and creativley orginal with the limitations of only using the languages that we have been taught thus far.

### Objectives
-To create a preliminary portfolio site that will serves as inspiration and provide a guide of areas to improve my web development skills.
-To practice/demonstrate knowledge of JS, CSS and HTML thus far.
-Expierence building a site from scratch.
-Stretch creative abilities.
-Learn from mistakes and reflect on other/dryer ways to achieve the same functionality/asethetic.

## Setting up the Project
1. If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

2. Set up a Repository on Github:
    -Go to (https://github.com) 
    -login and click on the green button 'New' next to 'Top Repositories'
    -Name your new repository, make it public, and add a README file
    -At the bottom of the page click 'Create repository (This will bring you to another page, it should take a few seconds)

3. Adding your new repositiory to your local server
    - Create a new directory in your terminal and label it 'Beta Portfolio'
    - Go back to your new repository on Github, click on the green button that says '<> Code'
    - Copy the SSH link and and go back to your terminal
    -In the new directory you just created type 'git clone' and then paste your SSH link and press enter

    Congrats! You have now created a new repostory and link it to your local server!

# Approach Taken
The approach I took was to first research a plethora of different portfolio sites from other Software Engineers so that I was able to grasp an idea of what the minimum industry standard is. 
After reasearching the professional standard, I also decided to look at other web designs/pages for inspiration on how I would organize/format my page creatively. Doing these two steps first not only allowed me to come up with my own ideas creatively, but also informed what kind of user interactions I would be using on my site based off of what makes the most sense with my design; as opposed to adding in UI that was simply there to meet the MVP of my project.

After general formating, color palettes ideas, UI, and some animations to include were decided upon I followed this general path:
    1. formatted all of my HTML
    2. Gave all of my HTML elements basic CSS borders to correctly arrange them on the page
    3. After the skeleton of my site was complete, I then began to actually start coding/styling pieces of my site, starting from my header/nav and working my way down may page. Making sure everuthing lined up correctly to the objects above it.
    4. After my styling was complete, I then started to create my UI in my JS file.
    5. Lastly I went in to adjust all of my CSS for a media query ( Saving this step for last was actually a big mistake and a huge learning opprotunity)

# Technologies
    1. CSS animatons:
     -text sliders => use keyframes to create a slide type writing effect of the home page
     2. JQuery/JS 
     - smooth scroll => created fucntions that will animate the body and offset you from your location to the a new location on the page when the event click happens
     - dark-mode => When the sun or moon icon inmy nav bar is toggled, you get varied CSS styling on the page. This works because the toggling of the moon/sun uodates the class in the CSS and the classes have different rules/styling.
     - modal => created a modal that serves as a contact me form. This happens when a button is clicked and it changes the CSS display style from 'flex' to 'none' and vice versa.
     - slide up effect => similar to all the other interactions, when certain buttons are clicked/toggled the display slideups up to a display of none, and slides down to display itself again.

# Unsolved Problems

Like mentioned earleir, there a 2 major things that I would do very differently the next time:
    1. Code Media query concurrently as I am creating my main CSS. Going back at the end for the CSS almost was the same as writing all of the rules the first time and very time consuming. Writing it at the same time as your main CSS not only saves time and headaches but improves your design/layout overall. This definetly something I will be going back in to fix.
    2. Creating more dynamic and dry functions. E.G. my page scroll fucntions work correctly but I had to create as many fucntions as I had sections, so figuring out ways to dry code that so in the future I don't have super long code when working on larger projects.

    Overall it was a great learning expieruence and was extremely fun as well as challenging. Extremely proud of what I was able to accomplish with limited language knowledge, which makes me not only excited to return to this project when I have gotten better but to push myslef further with accessibility of the new languages/frameworks I learn.
